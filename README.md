# J's Portfolio Site

I have actually been working on this on and off for a while -- another version of it lives at [jlriley.com](http://jlriley.com) -- but I was happy to get a chance to really sit down and work on getting some more information on there.

### HTML

- Used three-column setup learned from various agency work over the years; 1/3 floats
- Strong typographic focus; photo of self and project feature images only visible on hover/scroll


### CSS

- The border took me some time; I had to look on [CSStricks](https://css-tricks.com/body-border/) for the correct method. Using `body {border:15px solid seagreen}` created a border around just the area with content, instead of covering the full window.



### Javascript

I utilized some Javascript in the project links -- rather than attempting to apply an href to a whole div or leaving just the project name clickable, it seemed more user-friendly to set up the whole div with an `onClick()` function. It doesn't seem to fire on first click all the time, though.

The password protection for the "Agency" project is borrowed from [Javascript Kit](http://www.javascriptkit.com/script/cut10.shtml) with some minor modifications. It's not secure at all, so it's just a temporary measure until I learn something better.

## What's Next?

- Redo the portfolio previews as I'm not 100% happy with the look - but I don't want the ordinary boxes either. Maybe it's a matter of cropping the representative images differently.
- Add short detail blurbs to portfolio previews
- Add dedicated project pages
- Figure out what goes in the center of the bottom menu
- Add contact form
